/**
 * Works through what the downloads store says is owed.
 *
 * There is no list of jobs here. The queue asks [DownloadStore.pending] what is
 * still wanted and has no file, downloads some of it, and asks again — so
 * adding a playlist, removing one, or killing the app mid-way all need no
 * special handling: the next question gets the right answer. [wake] exists only
 * to say "the answer may have changed", never to hand over work.
 *
 * Two reasons to stop are kept apart, because they mean opposite things to the
 * listener:
 *
 * - **The track failed.** Recorded against the track, retried with a growing
 *   wait, and eventually given up on. One unavailable song does not stop a
 *   playlist.
 * - **We cannot download at all** — no connection, mobile data while the
 *   listener asked for Wi-Fi only, or no engine yet. Nothing is recorded
 *   against any track; the queue waits and carries on where it left off. This
 *   is the distinction that stops a tunnel from burning five attempts on every
 *   remaining track of a playlist.
