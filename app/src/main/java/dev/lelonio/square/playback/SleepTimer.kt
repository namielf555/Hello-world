/**
 * When the music is to stop on its own.
 *
 * Held here rather than on the screen that sets it: what stops the music is
 * the service, which outlives every screen, and a countdown that lived in the
 * player's panel would be one that only ran while somebody was watching it.
 * The same reason OfflineMode is an object.
 *
 * Two kinds, because they answer two different questions. A deadline is "I am
 * going to sleep now"; the end of the track is "let this one finish". Asking
 * for either clears the other, since holding both would leave the listener
 * guessing which one stops the music.
 *
 * The deadline is on the clock that counts while the phone sleeps and does not
 * move when the time of day does: a timer set for twenty minutes is twenty
 * minutes whatever the phone thinks the hour is.
