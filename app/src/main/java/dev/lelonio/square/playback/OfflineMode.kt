/**
 * Whether the app is playing from the phone rather than from Spotify.
 *
 * An object rather than something injected, for the same reason
 * [dev.lelonio.square.data.RemoteConnect] is one: there is a single engine
 * behind it and the answer is wanted from the service, the player and half the
 * screens.
 *
 * ### Three ways in, and only one of them is about the engine
 *
 * - [Reason.MANUAL] — the listener asked for it in Settings. Beats everything.
 * - [Reason.NO_SESSION] — the handshake could not be made and the engine came
 *   up with no Spirc at all. This is the real one: nothing can be streamed
 *   because there is nothing to stream from.
 * - [Reason.SLOW] — the connection is there but worse than the copies on the
 *   phone. Deliberately **does not** tear the session down. Going offline for
 *   real over a bad minute would cost the Connect device and the way back, for
 *   a problem that fixes itself; what this changes is only what the app offers
 *   to play, which is the whole of what the listener asked for. A downloaded
 *   track already plays from disk in every mode — see `load_downloaded_track`
 *   — so the streamed ones are the only ones this decides about.
