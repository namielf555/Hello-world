/**
 * Speed and pitch for the players that are not the Spotify engine.
 *
 * Spotify's audio goes through the app's own sink, where a phase vocoder does
 * this work; a file on the phone goes through ExoPlayer, which has its own
 * stretcher built for speech. On music that one smears every attack and adds a
 * metallic edge, which is exactly what the same track sounds like on the two
 * paths at the same setting. This puts the same vocoder in ExoPlayer's chain,
 * so a song is altered the same way whatever it was read from.
 *
 * Sixteen-bit PCM only. Everything the decoders here hand over is that, and a
 * format this cannot take is passed through rather than refused: an untouched
 * song is a much better answer than silence.
