 * librespot loads one track at a time and has no notion of a playlist, so the
 * queue lives here and [LibrespotPlayer] advances it on `end_of_track`.
 *
 * Shuffle is implemented by reordering the list itself rather than keeping a
 * separate play order. `SimpleBasePlayer`'s timeline does not implement shuffle
 * ("TODO: Support shuffle order" upstream), so its next/previous would keep
 * walking the list linearly while end-of-track followed a shuffled order —
 * leaving the two disagreeing. Reordering the queue keeps one order for both.
 *
 * Not thread-safe by design: only the player's application looper touches it.
