/**
 * What the connection can actually carry, judged by listening rather than asking.
 *
 * The system's own estimate answers a different question: it reports the speed
 * of the radio link, which stays high behind a router that is throttling, a
 * captive network that is shaping, or a plan that has run out of fast data. A
 * phone can sit on a 300 Mbps wi-fi and receive 200 kbps, and the setting that
 * exists precisely for that case never noticed.
 *
 * So this watches what happens to the music. Two facts, both free:
 *
 * A **stall** is the honest one. If the sound stops while the player still
 * means to be playing, the buffer ran dry: whatever anyone estimated, it was
 * too much. One stall steps down immediately.
 *
 * A **slow load** is the early warning. The time between asking for a track and
 * hearing it is mostly the time spent fetching the first seconds of it, so a
 * load that takes longer than a track's worth of patience says the link is
 * behind before the music has had to stop.
 *
 * Coming back up is deliberately reluctant: several tracks in a row have to
 * load quickly and play through before the quality rises, because a link that
 * has just failed to carry 320 will happily fail again, and a listener notices
 * oscillation far more than they notice one step of bitrate.
 *
 * Nothing here rebuilds anything. The engine reads its bitrate when a track
 * loads, so a decision costs a message and is heard on the next song.
