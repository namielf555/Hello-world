/**
 * The same room, for the players that are not the Spotify engine.

 * The reverb on the Spotify path is not a filter this app wrote: it is
 * Android's own [EnvironmentalReverb], attached to the output as an auxiliary
 * effect with a send level. ExoPlayer offers the same attachment through
 * [ExoPlayer.setAuxEffectInfo], so a file on the phone can be put in exactly the
 * same room rather than in a second one that sounds nearly like it.
 *
 * The tuning is shared with [AudioOutput] on purpose; see [ReverbTuning]. Two
 * copies of these numbers would drift apart the first time either was touched.
