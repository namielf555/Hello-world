/**
 * Time stretching and pitch shifting, backed by Bungee.
 *
 * This replaces `AudioTrack.setPlaybackParams`. That path was free, but it runs
 * the platform's Sonic implementation, which is built for speech: on music it
 * smears transients and adds a metallic ring at anything beyond a few percent.
 * Bungee is a phase vocoder and holds together across the range this app offers.
 *
 * Not thread-safe: the native stretcher carries streaming state between calls,
 * so every method must be called from the one thread that writes audio.
