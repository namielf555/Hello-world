/**
 * Turns the app offline when the connection goes, and back when it returns.
 *
 * Offline used to be decided once, when the engine started, which left the
 * common case unhandled: a phone that loses signal while playing kept behaving
 * as though it were online — queues full of tracks it could not fetch, no line
 * on the page saying why, and a listener wondering what had broken.
 *
 * Losing the network waits a few seconds before it counts. Signal drops for a
 * moment in a lift or between cells, and an app that rearranged itself every
 * time would be worse than one that noticed late. Coming back counts at once:
 * there is nothing to protect against there, and the sooner the library is
 * whole again the better.
