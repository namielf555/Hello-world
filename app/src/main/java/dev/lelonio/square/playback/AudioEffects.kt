/**
 * Effect settings shared between the player UI and the playback service.
 *
 * A process-wide object rather than something passed through the media session:
 * the service and the UI run in the same process here, and reverb is not part of
 * the Media3 player interface, so there is no session command that carries it.
 * Speed and pitch deliberately do *not* live here — those are real
 * [androidx.media3.common.Player] state and go through `setPlaybackParameters`,
 * so the notification and any connected controller see them too.
 *
 * Persisted, on second thoughts. The first version deliberately reset on every
 * launch, on the reasoning that an app which reopened sounding altered would
 * seem broken. In use that was the wrong call: setting a slowed-and-reverbed
 * mood and losing it on the next launch — or on the next playlist — is the more
 * annoying of the two, and the effects panel makes the current state plain.
 *
 * [load] has to be called once before the values mean anything, and it is called
 * from the application object rather than from the service. Nothing may write
 * before it: a value set while the file has not been read is a value written
 * over what was saved, and the whole point of persisting was not to lose the
 * mood the listener set.
