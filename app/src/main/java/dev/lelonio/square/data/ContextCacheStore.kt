/**
 * Resolved track lists, kept on disk between runs.
 *
 * The in-memory cache above this only helps while the app is alive, and a
 * playlist of a thousand tracks is a dozen Web API pages: every cold start paid
 * for all of them, and the user watched the rows arrive a hundred at a time.
 *
 * Spotify stamps a playlist with a `snapshot_id` that changes whenever its
 * contents do, which is what makes a cache honest here rather than a gamble: one
 * small request says whether the twelve big ones are needed at all. Albums have
 * no such stamp and need none — an album does not gain tracks.
 *
 * One file per context. A single blob would have to be rewritten in full every
 * time any playlist changed, and would be read in full to open one.
