/**
 * What is downloaded, and who asked for it.
 *
 * The audio itself is the engine's business — `native/src/downloads.rs` writes
 * one encrypted file and one sidecar per track, and the player finds them
 * without ever asking this class. What lives here is everything the engine has
 * no opinion about: which playlists wanted a track, what a track is called so
 * it can be drawn with no connection, and which downloads have yet to happen.
 *
 * ### Owners, and why a track is not simply "downloaded"
 *
 * The requirement this whole class exists for is that a song in two downloaded
 * playlists is one file that both playlists know about. So nothing records "the
 * listener downloaded this track". What is recorded is a set of *owners* — a
 * playlist, an album, an artist, the loose collection of singles, the liked
 * songs — each holding the tracks it asked for, in order.
 *
 * Everything follows from that. Downloading a playlist that shares tracks with
 * one already downloaded costs no bytes. Removing a playlist removes an owner,
 * and the file goes only once no owner is left ([pruneOrphans]). A track shows
 * as downloaded inside the playlist it belongs to because that is the question
 * being asked, not because of a flag on the track.
 *
 * ### The queue is not stored
 *
 * There is no list of pending downloads on disk. What is pending is whatever an
 * owner asked for and has no file yet ([pending]), which means an app killed
 * mid-playlist works out what it still owes the moment it starts, and a
 * download interrupted halfway resumes from the `.part` file the engine left.
 * A queue file would have been a second truth to keep in step with this one.
