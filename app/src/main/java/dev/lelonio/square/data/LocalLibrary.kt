/**
 * The audio already on the phone.

 * Square hands downloading to whatever app the user has for it, so what comes
 * back is a file somewhere on the device rather than anything this app placed.
 * MediaStore is therefore the only sensible way to find it: it answers "what
 * audio is on this phone", which is the actual question, while a hardcoded
 * folder answers "what audio is where I guessed", and every downloader lets its
 * user change that.
 *
 * It also means the tags the downloader wrote are already parsed. Title, artist,
 * album, duration and the embedded cover come back from the index rather than
 * from this app opening files and reading headers.
 *
 * Visible whichever source is selected. A file on the phone is not a third
 * streaming service to switch to; it is there in both.
