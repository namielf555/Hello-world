/**
 * Apple Music's own pictures of an artist.
 *
 * Spotify has one square photograph per artist and nothing else. Apple's
 * catalogue has the two things an artist page in that style is made of: a wide
 * editorial portrait, and the artist's name drawn in a face chosen for them —
 * what their client puts across the top of the picture instead of setting the
 * name in the system font.
 *
 * How it is reached: the public web player carries a developer token inside its
 * own JavaScript, and that token opens the same catalogue endpoint the site
 * reads. Nothing here is authenticated as a person and nothing is written; this
 * asks for the artwork of a public catalogue page. It is, all the same, not an
 * interface Apple publishes, so every part of it is written to fail quietly: no
 * token, no match, a changed page shape or a refused request all end as "no
 * pictures", and the artist page draws its own name over Spotify's photo
 * exactly as it did before this file existed.
 *
 * Nothing calls this on the playback path. It is one lookup when an artist page
 * opens, cached for the session.
