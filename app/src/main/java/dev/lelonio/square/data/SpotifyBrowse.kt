 * Spotify's own browse pages, read as rows.

 * app". This answers a different and much larger question — what the catalogue
 * has to offer right now — and it is where the client's own Browse gets the new
 * releases chosen for a listener, the editors' playlists, the charts and the
 * daily mixes. The two overlap in places, which is why the pages that use this
 * drop anything the home already showed.
 *
 * Read exactly as forgivingly as [SpotifyHome], and for the same reason: this
 * is a private interface, so an unrecognised row is skipped rather than treated
 * as a failure.
