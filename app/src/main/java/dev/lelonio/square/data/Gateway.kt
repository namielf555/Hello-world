/**
 * Track lists read from Spotify's own GraphQL gateway.
 *
 * The endpoint the web player uses, and the reason to prefer it: the Web API
 * meters every request against an application the listener has to register for
 * themselves, and the access point answers a context with URIs that then cost
 * a round trip each to turn into names. This answers with whole tracks, two
 * hundred at a time, for anyone who is logged in.
 *
 * What it asks in return is that nothing here be relied on. A persisted query
 * is addressed by the hash of a query Spotify already knows, and those are
 * retired whenever its web client is rebuilt, so every read here can come back
 * with nothing and every caller has to have somewhere else to go. See
 * [PathfinderKeys] for how the hashes are kept current, and
 * native/src/pathfinder.rs for the request itself.
