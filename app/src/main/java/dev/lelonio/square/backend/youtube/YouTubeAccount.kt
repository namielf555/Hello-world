 * There is no OAuth here, and that is not a shortcut: YouTube Music has no
 * public API and issues no tokens to third parties. What `music.youtube.com`
 * itself uses is a session cookie plus a `SAPISIDHASH` header derived from it,
 * so signing in means letting the user log into Google in a web view and
 * keeping the cookie it leaves behind — see [YouTubeLoginScreen].
 *
 * Encrypted at rest like the Spotify tokens are: this cookie is full access to
 * the user's Google account, which makes it the most sensitive thing this app

     * a credential and can simply be asked for again.
