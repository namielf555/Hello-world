/**
 * The user's own Spotify application, used for Web API calls only.
 *
 * Playback authenticates as librespot's shared "keymaster" client, which is the
 * only id the access point accepts. That same id is useless for
 * `api.spotify.com`: the Web API meters requests per application over a rolling
 * window, and since every librespot-based client in the world shares that id,
 * its quota is permanently spent — which is why search answered 429 here no
 * matter how little this app asked for.
 *
 * The fix is the one Outify settled on: the user registers their own app in the
 * Spotify developer dashboard and pastes its client id, so Web API calls are
 * metered against a quota only they use. No client secret is involved — the flow
 * is PKCE, so nothing confidential is stored on the device.
 *
 * The two sessions are kept deliberately separate. Tokens are not
 * interchangeable between client ids, and mixing them is what would produce the
 * "logged in but every request is 401" state.
