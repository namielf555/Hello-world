 * SharedTransitionScope.sharedElement. Compiling the source here keeps it
 * binary-compatible.
 *
 * Kept as close to upstream as it can be. The library animates the fold itself
 * — shared bounds on a spring, with the crossfade only clearing away what has
 * no counterpart in the other state — and every local attempt to describe that
 * movement by hand made it worse. What this app adds goes through the seams the
 * library already has: the glass through tabBarContentModifier, the selection
