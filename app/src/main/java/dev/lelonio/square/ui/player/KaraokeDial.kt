/**
 * How much of the singing to take away.
 *
 * Closed it is a button with a microphone on it, the width of a thumb; touched,
 * it grows into a standing capsule filled from the bottom, which is dragged to
 * set the level and closes again when it is let go of. That is the shape Apple
 * gives the same idea, and the reason for it is the same: a lyric sheet is what
 * the panel is for, and a control that is used once a song should not hold a
 * band of it open the rest of the time.
