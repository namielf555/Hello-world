/**
 * The track's Canvas: a few seconds of video, looping behind the player.
 *
 * A second player instance, deliberately. The audio still comes from librespot —
 * this one is muted and only ever renders pictures. Feeding the clip through the
 * media session's player instead would mean the notification, the lock screen
 * and the queue all thought a video was the current item.
 *
 * Rendered into a TextureView, which is the whole reason this is inflated from a
 * layout instead of built in code — `surface_type` has no setter.
 *
 * A SurfaceView, the default, does render the clip: that much was checked, and
 * an earlier note here recorded it as proof that the surface type did not
 * matter. It does. A SurfaceView is composited by the system in its own window,
 * beneath the app's, and is therefore invisible to anything that records the
 * view hierarchy into a graphics layer — which is exactly what the glass panes
 * sample. They were refracting an empty layer, so they came out as flat
 * translucent rectangles with the video showing through them rather than in
 * them. A TextureView draws like any other view and can be recorded.
 *
 * Follows [isPlaying] so pausing the music stills the picture too; a clip that
 * keeps looping over a paused track reads as the app having lost track of
 * itself.
