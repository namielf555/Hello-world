/**
 * The room the player is in, made out of the record that is playing.
 *
 * Not a blurred cover behind a cover. The same picture is drawn much larger
 * than the screen, blurred past the point where anything in it can be made
 * out, and left as light and colour: what reaches the eye is the record's
 * palette filling the window, with the sharp copy above dissolving into it —
 * see [HeroBackdrop]'s `fadeToPage`, which is the other half of this.
 *
 * Three things make it read as a room rather than as a wallpaper:
 *
 * - two copies at different blurs, the softer one filling the frame and the
 *   sharper one over it at low opacity, which gives the field a near and a far
 *   and stops it looking like flat paper;
 * - a drift so slow it is never caught moving, which is what keeps a still
 *   screen from looking switched off;
 * - a crossfade on a track change that is slower than the cover's own, so the
 *   room changes around the picture instead of with it.
 *
 * ## What this deliberately does not do
 *
 * There is no `Modifier.blur` here and no `RenderEffect`. Both are render
 * effects over a layer, re-run every frame that layer changes — and this layer
 * changes on every frame of the drift, of the crossfade, and of the player
 * opening. The blur is done once per cover, at decode, on an image small enough
 * that the work is trivial, and Coil keeps the result: see [BlurTransformation].
 * That also settles the compatibility question, since it is ordinary bitmap
 * work on every version the app runs on.
 *
 * Everything that animates is read inside a `graphicsLayer` block, which the
 * compose runtime defers to the draw phase: the drift and the crossfade never
 * recompose anything and never re-decode anything. They move a texture the GPU
 * already has.
