/**
 * The now-playing bar and the player, as one surface.
 *
 * The previous version made the player a navigation destination and tried to
 * animate between the two. That can only ever cross-fade: they are separate
 * screens, both on stage at once, and no amount of shared-element work hides
 * that the bar and the player are two different things pretending to be one.
 *
 * They still are, in the sense that matters: one `progress` value owns both, so
 * the bar and the player are two views of a single state rather than two screens
 * taking turns.
 *
 * How that value is spent went through a growing container — the bar's height
 * stretched up to the window's, with the player already laid out full size
 * inside it. It looked right and it was never quite smooth: resizing that
 * container re-ran a layout pass over a screen holding a video surface and
 * several pieces of live glass, sixty times a second, and deferring every state
 * read only moved the cost around.
 *
 * So the travel is now a transform and nothing else. The player is full size
 * from the first frame, rises a little way into place and fades in as the bar
 * fades out under it. One layer, scaled and faded on the render thread, with no
 * measure or layout anywhere in the frame.
 *
 * The same value is what a drag writes to, which is why dragging down works at
 * any point and can be released anywhere: expansion is a position, not an event.
 *
 * There is no collapsed half any more. There used to be one — a bar the width of
 * the screen, carrying what was playing and the drag that opened the player — and
 * once the tab bar grew its own now-playing pill it stayed behind as an empty
 * strip: invisible, sixty-odd dp tall, sitting across the bottom of every page
 * and still listening for a vertical drag. An upward swipe over the last of a
 * list opened the player, from a thing nobody could see. What opens it now is the
 * pill itself, which is where what is playing actually is.
 *
 * @param progress 0 while collapsed, 1 while expanded. Hoisted because the tab
 *   bar has to fade out against it.
