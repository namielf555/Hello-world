/**
 * A picture that stops being a picture on its way down the screen.
 *
 * Two copies of the same image: the sharp one, and over its lower half a
 * blurred one that fades in, and then the page's own colour arriving under
 * that. It is what makes a photograph dissolve into a page instead of ending —
 * a straight fade to a flat colour leaves the image crisp right up to the point
 * where it vanishes, which reads as a photo behind a curtain.
 *
 * Shared by the pages that are made of one picture — an artist, a record, a
 * list — and by the player when the track has nothing moving to show. One
 * treatment, so the cover looks the same wherever the app puts it up large.
 *
 * Blurred at decode time rather than with `Modifier.blur`: that modifier is a
 * render effect over the whole layer, re-run on every frame the layer changes,
 * and this sits under everything.
