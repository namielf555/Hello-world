/**
 * Glass over the album art.
 *
 * The page is the record that is playing — a colour taken from the artwork,
 * never a flat sheet — and the system's setting decides which way that colour
 * is taken. Dark takes it down towards the floor and puts light ink and a dark
 * film of glass on it; light takes the same colour up towards paper and puts
 * dark ink and a white film on it. One palette, read in two directions, rather
 * than two palettes.
 *
 * `background` is transparent on purpose: whatever draws the backdrop sits
 * behind the whole tree, and an opaque page colour would cover it.
 *
 * What follows is the original note, still true of the accent:
 *
 * The neutrals do all the structural work — page, cards, text, borders are a
 * single grey ramp — and the accent seeded from the current cover is spent only
 * where the interface needs to say "this one, right now": the play button, the
 * played part of the waveform, an enabled toggle, the current row. Kept that
 * narrow, colour reads as state rather than as decoration, and the covers stay
 * the most colourful thing on screen.
 *
 * The seed is pushed toward legibility rather than used raw: a cover's dominant
 * colour is as likely to be near-black as near-white, and either one vanishes
 * against the wrong background.
 */
/**
 * Which side the app is on, said plainly.
 *
 * Read off the scheme's own surface at first, and that was wrong in a way that
 * only showed on the other side: every film in this design is a translucent
 * *white*, so `surface.luminance()` is 1.0 in both settings — alpha is not part
 * of luminance. Everything keyed on it would have called the dark theme light.
