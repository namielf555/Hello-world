/**
 * Light in the cover's own colours, moving, for a track with no Canvas.
 *
 * Most of the catalogue has no clip, and those tracks got a still blurred cover
 * where the rest of the app has something alive. This invents nothing about the
 * song: it is the artwork's own palette drifting behind the glass.
 *
 * Built for the glass rather than for itself. A pane of liquid glass shows what
 * is behind it bent at its edges, and bending an even wash of colour produces an
 * even wash of colour — the first version was three soft blobs and the panels
 * above it barely registered that anything had changed. What a lens has
 * something to do with is an *edge*, so this draws edges: beams with a hard
 * flank sweeping across the screen, and small bright caustics travelling with
 * them. Under glass those read as the refraction moving.
 *
 * Slow, all the same. The periods are not multiples of one another, so nothing
 * on screen ever pulses in time with anything else, and a screen you look at for
 * the length of an album must not be doing anything you can count.
