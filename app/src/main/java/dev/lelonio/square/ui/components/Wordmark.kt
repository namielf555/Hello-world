/**
 * The name, drawn rather than typeset.
 *
 * The icon is a square wave: one stroke width, right angles only, no curve
 * anywhere. No font shipped with Android says that — a bold sans still has
 * round bowls on S and Q and a diagonal on R — and pulling in a display face
 * for six letters costs more than the six letters do.
 *
 * So the letterforms are the same primitive as the icon: polylines on a 6×10
 * grid, orthogonal segments, square caps and joins. The Q's tail drops below
 * the baseline, which is the one thing that keeps it from reading as an O.
 *
 * Sized by its height: the width follows from the grid, so callers give this a
 * height and let it measure itself.

 * the film and the rim have a gradient to sit on, and alive, because that
 * colour slides to a new one every time the music changes.
 *
 * Flat, deliberately. This sits in a header that moves with the scroll, and a
