/**
 * A context menu, in a window of its own so nothing can be drawn over it.
 *
 * It went through both other options first, and both are worse. Material's
 * `DropdownMenu` is an opaque elevated card — the one surface in the app that
 * announces it came from a different design system. Drawing it inside the
 * screen instead let it refract the page properly, and put it *under* the mini
 * player and the tab bar, which are drawn above the whole navigation host: a
 * menu with the now-playing bar across it.
 *
 * So: a popup. A popup is its own window and cannot sample a layer belonging to
 * another one, which means no real refraction, which in turn is why this is
 * opaque rather than a pane of glass with nothing behind it. It keeps the shape,
 * the corner radius and the hairline of the rest of the app, and gives up the
 * one property it cannot honestly have.
 *
 * @param anchor where the menu's top-left corner goes, in pixels from the top
 *   left of the window. See [MENU_WIDTH] for placing it by its right edge.
