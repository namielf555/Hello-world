/**
 * A pane of glass over [backdrop].
 *
 * One call for every glass surface outside the bottom bar: the sheets, the
 * menus, the cards a link opens, the player's own panels. What it is made of is
 * not decided here any more — it defers to the bar's [liquidGlass], so there is
 * a single answer in the app to what glass looks like, and changing it changes
 * everything at once.
 *
 * Everything degrades on its own below Android 13: the library checks for
 * RuntimeShader support and skips the refraction, leaving the blur, and below
 * Android 12 the blur goes too. What is left is a plain translucent surface, so
 * the screen stays usable rather than breaking on older phones.
 */
/**
 * Whether panes refresh what they are reflecting, or hold the last look at it.
 *
 * False while the player is in motion. A pane's blur and lens are RuntimeShaders
 * sampling a recorded layer, and during the expansion that layer changes every
 * frame — several full-screen shader passes per frame, which is most of what
 * made the animation stutter.
 *
 * It used to mean "no glass at all", and the pane fell back to a plain film for
 * the length of the travel. That saved the same work and cost a visible one:
 * this is the only surface in the player that answers the flag, so the title
 * capsule alone arrived as a flat grey patch among panes of glass and turned
 * into glass a frame after the player stopped. Holding the recording gets the
 * saving without the change of material — what is behind the player barely
 * moves anyway, being the artwork it is opening over.

/**
 * Whether the player is standing still.
 *
 * False for the frames of an opening or a closing, and read by the two things
 * in the player that are video: a TextureView inside a layer that is being
 * scaled and faded has its surface detached and re-attached around the change,
 * and draws black for the length of the travel — a black rectangle sliding down
 * the screen, and the last thing to go.
 *
 * Kept apart from [LocalGlassEnabled], which the sheet used to answer this
 * question with. That one carries the listener's glass setting as well, so a
 * player with the glass turned off had no moving cover either — two unrelated
 * things behind one flag.
