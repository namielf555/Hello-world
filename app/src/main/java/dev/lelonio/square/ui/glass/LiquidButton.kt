//
// These are the library author's own example components rather than part of the
// published artifact, so there is nothing to depend on — they have to be copied.
// Kept as close to upstream as possible (package line and a few Material
// swaps aside) so a later upstream fix can be diffed in; see LICENSE-backdrop.txt.
